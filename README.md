## Usage

A full usage example can be seen [here](#example-usage).

Once installed, LaunchMate's settings can be found within the "Generic" section of Playnite's addon settings menu.

The main settings page displays a table of all Launch Groups you've added. To create a new one, click "Add". This will open the [Launch Group Editor window](#the-launch-group-editor) for a new Launch Group. 

### The Launch Group Editor

In this window you can choose the target application or website the group will launch, set the delay timer for application launch, and select the conditions a game must meet to launch the target. To make selecting an application easier, click the button with a file icon next to the input box.

The table at the bottom of the Launch Group Editor window is where you can set the conditions for your launch group. See ["How to use the conditions section"](#how-to-use-the-conditions-section) to understand how to use this table.

The Launch Group Editor window has a button at the bottom to preview matched games. This button can also be found for each Launch Group on the main settings window.


### How to use the conditions section

The table within the Launch Group Editor display all **Condition Groups** for that Launch Group. Click "Add" to create a new group. See ["Condition Groups Table Reference"](#condition-groups-table-reference)

This will open a new window with a table of conditions for that group. Once again, click "Add" to add a new condition. See ["Condition Table Reference"](#condition-table-reference)

### Condition Groups Table Reference

| NOT | Conditions | Next Logical Operator |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| If set, the result of this condition group will be negated | A textual representation of the conditions within the group | The logical operator placed between a condition group and the condition group that follows it |
| See matching column in ["Condition Table Reference"](#condition-table-reference) for context | -> means "matches" | E.g. if set to AND, the condition groups are true only if both the condition group and the one following it are true |
| | ~> means "fuzzy matches" | |
| | NOT means "does not match" | |
| | NOT~ means "does not fuzzy match" | |

<br><br>

### Condition Table Reference

| NOT | Filter Type | Filter | Fuzzy Match | Next Logical Operator |
| -------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| If set, the result of this condition will be negated | The game attribute to check the filter against | The filter with which to check the game attribute | If set, filter matches can be close but not exact | The logical operator placed between a condition and the condition that follows it |
| E.g. if the condition checks that the game name matches "Stardew" and this is Not is checked, it will be true for any game whose name does not match "Stardew"| If set to "All Games", it will match any game | This filter supports regex or standard strings | | E.g. if set to AND, the conditions are true only if both the condition and the one following it are true |

### Example usage

To launch the application blitz.gg with any game made by Riot Games except for Legends of Runeterra, you have a few options. Two of them would be:

1. Set up two condition groups, the first checks that "Source" matches "Riot Games" and the second checks that "Name" does not match "Runeterra". Check "Not" on the second group and set the "Next Logical Operator" of the first group to "AND".

2. Set up one condition group containing both a check that "Source" matches "Riot Games" and a check that "Name" does not match "Runeterra". Set the "Next Logical Operator" of the first group to "AND".

Either of these methods results in the following matches:
