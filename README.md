# Installation
- Method 1: Install directly from within Playnite in the Addon Browser
- Method 2: Click the download link on Playnite's addon page [here](https://playnite.link/addons.html#LaunchMate_61d7fcec-322d-4eb6-b981-1c8f8122ddc8)
- Method 3: Download the latest .pext file from releases and open it using Playnite

## Usage

An indepth usage example can be seen [here](#example-usage).

Once installed, LaunchMate's settings can be found on the left sidebar or within the "Generic" section of Playnite's addon settings menu.

The main settings page displays a tab view of all Launch Groups you've added. To create a new one, click "Add". This will open the launch group editor on the right side of the settings window.

### The Launch Group Editor

In this window you can choose the action that will be executed by the launch group, the settings for the launch group, and select the conditions a game must meet to launch the target. 

The table at the bottom of the Launch Group Editor window is where you can set the conditions for your launch group. See ["How to use the conditions section"](#how-to-use-the-conditions-section) to understand how to use this table.

The Launch Group Editor window has a button at the bottom to preview matched games.


### How to use the conditions section

In this table you add the conditions that determine if the launch group will execute its action. Click "Add" to add a new condition. 

Choose which type of filter the condition will have using the drop down menu, and then fill in the filter. You can click the search icon next to the filter box for easier filter selection or you can type in the filter yourself.

Note that when you use the selection box the filter will be associated with the ID of whichever filter you select. This means that if the name of the filtered item changes the filter will still be associated with the renamed value. For example, if you select "Steam" as a source filter and then change the name of the "Steam" source in Playnite to "Steam Games", the filter will still trigger on "Steam Games". This will not happen if you type in the filter yourself.

See ["Condition Table Reference"](#condition-table-reference) for more information on each table column.

### Condition Table Reference

| Exclude | Filter Type | Filter | Fuzzy Match | Next Logical Operator |
| -------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| If set, the result of this condition will be negated | The game attribute to check the filter against | The filter with which to check the game attribute | If set, filter matches can be close but not exact | The logical operator placed between a condition and the condition that follows it |
| E.g. if the condition checks that the game name matches "Stardew" and Exclude is checked, it will be true for any game whose name does not match "Stardew"| If set to "All Games", it will match any game | Can be typed in or auto-filled using the search box | | E.g. if set to AND, the conditions are true only if both the condition and the one following it are true |

9. Add two more conditions, one for the game name being "Legends of Runeterra" and another checking if blitz.gg is already running. Check the "Exclude" box for both so that the conditions check if the game name is NOT "Legends of Runeterra" and Blitz.gg is NOT running. Also make sure "Next Logical Operator" is set to "And" for all conditions
